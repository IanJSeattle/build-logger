generic database-based logging system, intended in this case for
logging build time/activity/photos as building an airplane.

multiple interfaces with the db:

* log input: enter activity, links to photo galleries, time spent as
  well as category, subcategory, helpers, etc.  probably command line

* pretty display: web-based display of log with user-controlled sorting
  of columns, limiting to certain categories, etc.

* pretty input: more or less the same as long input, but via www form.
  probably not necessary, but might be nice to have if the system gets
  published.  password-protected.

things to track:

* date/time of log entry
* category (fuselage, wings, engine, etc.)
* subcategory
* hours or minutes spent
* description of activity
* main worker
* helpers

in a separate table: (not sure if this is worthwhile)
* date/time of expense
* cost
* item(s) purchased
