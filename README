This project is a logging program, for keeping track of an hourly
activity.  I first built it to track building my biplane project.

It is console-mode, with no graphics or fancy point-and-click anything.

It uses the sqlite3 database engine.  The resulting file is copied up
to my website server, where it powers the build log, and dashboard,
which can be seen here:

I'm afraid this has a lot of assumptions built in, but I post it in the
hopes that others find it useful.
